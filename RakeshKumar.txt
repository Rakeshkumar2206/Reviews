Review Title, "<span id="k">Airpod's Pro vs Blon Bl03</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

Hey There! Welcome to my Review section, where<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>You can see all the reviews of the products which i have used.</p>
<p>First Let's talk about IEM </p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p>In Ear Monitor's are commonly known as IEM. These things are used by professional musicians to audiophiles to hear the exact representation of the audio which was intended to produce. They are made to give natural and warm sound and IEM's always tend to reproduce the exact sound made by the musicians. So these are acurate and good AF. 

Now Lets talk about the star of the show, "<span id="k"> Blon Bl03</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

<p>     When I unboxed this IEM, the first thing I took out from that box is the pair of monitors which comes out like a small pebble made out of sterling silver it was pure and cold to touch and felt like a densely packed raindrop straight out of heaven. Further diving in the box I found out that they gave us some cheaped out 4 core cable which does the job but not good enough to pair it up with this precious monitor’s.The Blon Bl03 is a Chifi IEM made by Linsoul audio, techincally they are not the creators but they are the only known distributors of this Specific IEM. Linsoul Audio sells many brands like Kz's,TIN, Moondrop and much more. Blon is an another big thing to their portfolio.
<p>       I Never expected this from a Rs.2,000 IEM's. Then i started plugging in the cheap cable it came with and all set and started to play some of my WAV files using my ipad to get the real High fidelity experience as a beginer and i totally got suprised the first thing i noticed was the clarity I got from the montior's it was clear AF. The tonality was on point and the sound it produced was really warm. 

"<span id="k">SOUND STAGING & SEPERATION </span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

<p>The staging was really good, you can feel the depth and the width of the song as it was recorded, the sound wasn’t quite roomy but good enough. The Blon have a great instrument separation standard each and every instrument was uniquely identifiable. [Make sure the song you listen has been mastered good enough, or else the separation cannot be felt].     


"<span id="k"> TONALITY  </span>".<!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>The Blon Bl03 has been tuned in a great manner where you can hear the voice of the artist in a natural and smooth flow where it doesn’t produce any artifact or unnatural tones; the tonality of the earphone was too good to be true. Imagine you being in a live concert and listening to your favourite artist, that’s how it was warm and really good sound signature.The tonality was in accurate representation you will never get this kinda of tonality from a sub Rs.20,000 earphone. Thanks to the guy who tuned this earphone. he has done a wonderful job.

"<spand id="k">FREQUENCY, POWER OUTPUT & BASS RESPONSE</span>".<!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>Sounds have a wide variety of frequency range and the more the frequency the better the detail of the sound. Blon had better frequency range and it had really good level of amplitude so make sure you listen to lesser volume or else you might get temporary tinnitus. The next good thing was bass response the bass coming out of these monitors were sharp and solid you can feel the thump, if you pair it up with the right set of ear tips you can pretty much have a party in your ears.

"<span id="k"> Important Misc</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>The Blon earphones were insanely good for the price factor comparing it with the top notch and high end IEM's, it is really good and worth for the every penny you drop. 

<p>Relation ship status is currently single and would love to maintain that forz a few more years. <br><br><br>You can view my grizzly printed face at Instagram . <a href="https://www.instagram.com/localhost_192.168.0.1/?hl=en"> Here you go</a>.</p><!-- Instagram ID -->
