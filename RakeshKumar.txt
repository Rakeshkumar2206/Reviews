Review Title, "<span id="k">Airpod's Pro vs Blon Bl03</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

Hey There! Welcome to my Review section, where<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>You can see all the reviews of the products which i have used.</p>
<p>First Let's talk about IEM </p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p>In Ear Monitor's are commonly known as IEM. These things are used by professional musicians to audiophiles to hear the exact representation of the audio which was intended to produce. They are made to give natural and warm sound and IEM's always tend to reproduce the exact sound made by the musicians. So these are acurate and good AF. 

Now Lets talk about the star of the show, "<span id="k"> Blon Bl03</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

"<span id="k">FIRST IMPRESSION</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p> As soon as I got the IEM setup, I took out my trusty old ipad where I had some wav songs in it and fried it up and the first wow factor for me was the clarity, there was nothing blocking the true sound coming out of the monitors they were clear, precise and accurate. The IEM was reproducing sound in a really good manner where you cannot complain it for the price you have spent on it. 


"<span id="k">SOUND STAGING & SEPERATION </span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

<p>   The staging was really good, you can feel the depth and the width of the song as it was recorded the sound wasn’t quite roomy but good enough. The Blon have a great instrument separation standard each and every instrument was uniquely identifiable. [Make sure the song you listen has been mastered good enough, or else the separation cannot be felt]. 

"<span id="k"> TONALITY  </span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>	The Blon Bl03 has been tuned in a great manner where you can hear the voice of the artist in a natural and smooth flow where it doesn’t produce any artifact or unnatural tones; the tonality of the earphone was too good to be true. Imagine you being in a live concert and listening to your favourite artist, that’s how it was warm and really good sound signature. The tonality was in accurate representation you will never get this kinda of tonality from a sub Rs.20,000 earphone. Thanks to the guy who tuned this earphone. he has done a wonderful job.

"<span id="k">FREQUENCY, POWER OUTPUT & BASS RESPONSE</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p> Sounds have a wide variety of frequency range and the more the frequency the better the detail of the sound. Blon had better frequency range and it had really good level of amplitude so make sure you listen to lesser volume or else you might get temporary tinnitus. The next good thing was bass response the bass coming out of these monitors were sharp and solid you can feel the thump, if you pair it up with the right set of ear tips you can pretty much have a party in your ears.
<p> The next big thing in this earphone was the bass response. I'am a avid bass lover and i think that bass is a thing which make some normal lousy songs to a energetic song. So i love bass a lot and this IEM was a no brainer for a bass lover, don't get me wrong this earphone does't boost any audio or pump any extra bass out of those drivers. It provides bass which is lot crispier and stronger. Not your average earphones which kinda produce it mushier and muddier.  

"<span id="k">MISC & PRICE FACTORS </span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>	The Blon earphones were insanely good for the price factor comparing it with the top notch and high end IEM it is really and worth for the every penny you drop.
