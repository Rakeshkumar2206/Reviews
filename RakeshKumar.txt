Review Title, "<span id="k">Airpod's Pro vs Blon Bl03</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

Hey There! Welcome to my Review section, where<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>You can see all the reviews of the products which i have used.</p>
<p>First Let's talk about IEM </p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p>In Ear Monitor's are commonly known as IEM. These things are used by professional musicians to audiophiles, to hear the exact representation of the audio which was intended to produce. They are made to give natural and warm sound and IEM's always tend to reproduce the exact sound made by the musicians. So these are acurate and good AF. 

Now Lets talk about the star of the show, "<span id="k"> Blon Bl03</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

"<span id="k">FIRST IMPRESSION</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p> As soon as I got the IEM setup, I took out my trusty old ipad where I had some WAV songs in it and fired it up and the first wow factor for me was the clarity, there was nothing blocking the true sound coming out of the monitors they were clear, precise and accurate. The IEM was reproducing sound in a really good manner where you cannot complain it for the price you have spent on it. 


"<span id="k">SOUND STAGING & SEPERATION </span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>The staging was really good, you can feel the depth and width of the song as it was recorded, the sound wasn’t quite roomy but good enough. The Blon have a great instrument separation standard each and every instrument was uniquely identifiable. [Make sure the song you listen has been mastered good enough, or else the separation cannot be felt]. 

"<span id="k"> TONALITY  </span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>	The Blon Bl03 has been tuned in a great manner where you can hear the voice of the artist in a natural and smooth flow where it doesn’t produce any artifact or unnatural tones; the tonality of the earphone was too good to be true. Imagine you being in a live concert and listening to your favourite artist, that’s how it was warm and really good sound signature. The tonality was in accurate representation, you will never get this kinda of tonality from a sub Rs.20,000 earphone. Thanks to the guy who tuned this earphone, he has done a wonderful job.

"<span id="k">FREQUENCY, POWER OUTPUT & BASS RESPONSE</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p> Sounds have a wide variety of frequency range and the more the frequency the better the detail of the sound. Blon had better frequency range and it had really good level of amplitude, so make sure you listen to lesser volume or else you might get temporary tinnitus. The next good thing was bass response the bass coming out of these monitors were sharp and solid you can feel the thump, if you pair it up with the right set of ear tips you can pretty much have a party in your ears.
<p> The next big thing in this earphone was the bass response. I'am a avid bass lover and i think that bass is a thing which make some normal lousy songs to a energetic song. So i love bass a lot and this IEM was a no brainer for a bass lover, don't get me wrong this earphone doesn't boost any audio or pump any extra bass out of those drivers. It provides bass which is lot crispier and stronger. Not your average earphones which kinda produce it mushier and muddier.  

"<span id="k">MISC & PRICE FACTORS </span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>	The Blon earphones were insanely good for the price factor comparing it with the top notch and high end IEM, it is really and worth for the every penny you drop.

Now Lets talk about the competitor, "<span id="k">Airpods Pro </span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

"<span id="k">GENERAL THOUGHTS</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>Air pod’s Pro is really a very sophisticated device made for a general consumer and an average audio listener. Just ripping the audio quality apart from it, we can assure you that it is one of a tailor fit made device which was stuffed inside apple’s eco system it works phenomenally well with apple products. The product integration, build quality and Active noise cancellation all of these features work really well and it looks like this device has been put up well.


"<span id="k">SOUND STAGING & SEPERATION</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>These pods have some special feature known as spatial audio which brings a theatre like experience to your ears but it doesn’t support every audio file you throw at it, you have to listen to the songs through apple music to get those experience. When I heard the spatial audio. I thought it was the end of staging in normal IEM’s, because you cannot get the spatial audio experience in any of the high end IEM, it is a feature that the air pod’s pro should be praised for, apple has integrated it really well and with spatial audio I was able to feel the sound and to be honest I was able to feel the direction of the sound as it was meant to be  projected, it was really very great to have these kind of features to be dumped in such a tiny pod’s.
<p>These are the only good things about airpod’s in the staging department rather than that, the staging was really average with normal music listening nothing extraordinary, the instrument separation was somewhat good nothing great, I was able to hear instruments at low volume and only with less instrument interference, If the bar is kept high when the tone is high and when several instruments join the party then the air pod’s cannot handle the pressure and yeah it cracks. I felt this as a real drawback and people listening to hard rock or metal songs will regret getting these pods.

"<span id="k">TONALITY </span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>The Tonality and clarity wasn’t that much great. Imagine getting a 25,000Rs earphones and getting thrashed by a 2000Rs IEM, yeah blon’s where superior in this page, the tonality of the blon’s were too good, where you cannot even compare with any other earphone under 20000Rs IEM, but these pods were really bad. It lacked in tonality where I cannot feel the song it felt like I was playing it through some normal mp3 player it did not have the liveliness of the blon’s . The clarity was really bad in air pod’s, if I have to convey you the exact representation of the sound of the airpod. Imagine placing a cloth between your ear diaphragm and the earphone’s, that’s how it was it filtered all the good sound texture and just gave us the the music which was bland, like serving steak without mashed potato and a steak sauce. Feels bad right, that’s how I felt when I listened music through this.

"<span id="k">FREQUENCY, POWER OUTPUT & BASS RESPONSE </span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>The power output was considerably less for normal listening too, for sure you might need a DAP to power this up to suit to your listening needs. I felt the volume was too less also after being at full volume. The bass response was good but not nothing amazing or great like blon, the bass in airpods felt muddy and mushy it was not strong or powerful as blon, inspite of having pressure valve built into them the airpods lacked punchy bass. 

"<span id="k">MISC & PRICE FACTORS </span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
<p>All though air pod’s had many draw backs, I loved some of the things it had like the ANC, these were packed inside air pod’s pro which was really good the noise isolation was perfect and it had transparency made to flush some environmental noise in while you are walking in a busy road for your safety, the noise cancellation is a major advantage of the pro’s. The integration with apple devices was too good like every other apple device. 
<p>Then considering the price range of 25,000Rs for a set of earphones which lacks all the basic quality of blon’s. I would definitely not recommend this to an audiophile but for an average user, who is already inside the apple ecosystem and want the best in class ANC and features like spatial audio and extra goodies, can get these. But these are not worth for the price you pay, but definetly a good buy considering the features it packs.
